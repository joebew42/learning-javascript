# Learning JavaScript

This repository contains a set of Code Kata I've used to practice and learn JavaScript.

## How to run the examples

1. Fetch all dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run all the tests

```
npm test
```

## What's going on?

- Salary Slip Kata https://github.com/sandromancuso/salaryslipkata

## Nice to learn

- Try the Bank Kata https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata
- Explore code coverage tools
- How to test the frontend code (interaction with the DOM, etc ...)?

## Resources I found about JavaScript

In JavaScript there is [NO concept of **Class**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

Everything is an [**Object**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch6.md).

Inheritance between objects is achieved with a mechanism known as [**Prototypal Inheritance**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

We can create Objects and then link them together **OLOO** (Objects-Linked-to-Other-Objects).

### Testing and JavaScript

- [JavaScript Unit Testing for Beginners](https://designmodo.com/test-javascript-unit/)
- Video about [Setting up Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-setting-up-unit-testing-with-mocha-and-chai)
- Video about [Unit Testing With Mocha and Chai](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-unit-testing-with-mocha-and-chai)
- Ended up with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) as assertions library, and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as test runner
  - Discovered that Chai allows three different assertion styles (Should, Expect and Assert). It's just a matter of style.
  - But there is also another Testing Framework to experiment with, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
