# Salary slip kata

## TODO FOR THE NEXT SESSION!

- Extract a `Salary` object
  - Add a Monthly Gross Salary field for the iteration 1
  - Add a National Insurance contribution field for the iteration 2
- [?] How to compare two objects? Do we need to implements a `#equals` method?

## Problem description: Salary slip generator for UK companies.

A typical salary slip contains employee details like employee id, employee name and their monthly salary details like their gross salary, national insurance contributions, tax-free allowance, taxable income and tax payable.

Salary slips are generated each month for every employee.

### Acceptance criteria:

- Salary slip generator should receive an employee with its Employee Id, Employee Name and Annual Gross Salary
- Salary slip should contain the Employee ID, Employee Name, Gross Salary, National Insurance contributions, Tax-free allowance, Taxable income and Tax payable for the month
- The entry point should be the following interface, which you can not change:

Java:

```java

      public class SalarySlipGenerator {
        public SalarySlip generateFor(Employee employee);
      }

```

C#:

```csharp
    public class SalarySlipGenerator
    {
        public SalarySlip GenerateFor(Employee employee);
    }
```

You can, however, add **private** methods and fields to the `SalarySlipGenerator` class, change the constructor, and add extra classes.

## Iterations

Each iteration adds more rules to the calculation. Some iterations also introduce new fields to the salary slip.

In a given iteration, all the salary slips contain the same number fields for each employee (if a tax or contribution does not apply for a given employee, just put £0.00).

This means that for each iteration you will need to add fields to the `SalarySlip` class. In the first iteration, `SalarySlip` only contains the Employee ID, Employee Name and Monthly Gross Salary.

#### Iteration 1: for an annual salary of £5,000.00

This is the most basic case.

  <p>*Given* I have an employee John J Doe with an annual gross salary of £5,000.00</p>
  <p>*When* I generate a monthly salary slip for the employee</p>
  <p>*Then* the monthly salary slip should contain the below:</p>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £416.67

Calculation rules:

- Monthly Gross Salary: The monthly gross salary is the employee's annual gross salary divided by 12

#### Iteration 2: for an annual gross salary of £9,060.00

Here we introduce the National Insurance contribution

  <p>The monthly salary slip should contain the below:</p>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £755.00
           National Insurance contributions: £10.00

Calculation rules:

- National Insurance contributions: Any amount of money earned above a gross annual salary of £8,060.00 is subject to a National Insurance contribution of 12%

#### Iteration 3: for an annual gross salary of £12,000.00

This employee also needs to pay taxes

  <p>The monthly salary slip should contain the below:</p>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £1,000.00
           National Insurance contributions: £39.40
           Tax-free allowance: £916.67
           Taxable income: £83.33
           Tax Payable: £16.67

Calculation rules:

- Taxable income: Any amount of money earned above a gross annual salary of £11,000.00 is taxed at 20%

#### Iteration 4: for an annual gross salary of £45,000.00

This employee pays a higher band of National Insurance and Income Tax.

  <p>The monthly salary slip should contain the below:</p>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £3,750.00
           National Insurance contributions: £352.73
           Tax-free allowance: £916.67
           Taxable income: £2,833.33
           Tax Payable: £600.00

Calculation rules:

- Taxable income (higher rate): Any amount of money earned above a gross annual salary of £43,000.00 is taxed at 40%
- National Insurance (higher contributions): Any amount of money earned above a gross annual salary of £43,000.00 is only subject to a 2% NI contribution

#### Iteration 5: for annual gross salaries of £101,000.00; £111,000.00; £122,000.00 and £150,000.00

For high earners, the tax-free allowance decreases.

  <p>The monthly salary slips should contain the below (respectively):</p>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £8,416.67
           National Insurance contributions: £446.07
           Tax-free allowance: £875.00
           Taxable income: £7,541.67
           Tax Payable: £2,483.33

   <br>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £9,250.00
           National Insurance contributions: £462.73
           Tax-free allowance: £458.33
           Taxable income: £8,791.67
           Tax Payable: £2,983.33

   <br>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £10,166.67
           National Insurance contributions: £481.07
           Tax-free allowance: £0.00
           Taxable income: £10,166.67
           Tax Payable: £3,533.33

   <br>

           Employee ID: 12345
           Employee Name: John J Doe
           Gross Salary: £12,500.00
           National Insurance contributions: £527.73
           Tax-free allowance: £0.00
           Taxable income: £12,500.00
           Tax Payable: £4,466.67

Calculation rules:

- Tax-free allowance: When the Annual Gross Salary exceeds £100,000.00, the tax-free allowance starts decreasing. It decreases by £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000.00. And this excess is taxed at the Higher rate tax.

#### Iteration 6: for an annual gross salary of £160,000.00

The employee goes into the additional rate band.

  <p>The monthly salary slip should contain the below:</p>

          Employee ID: 12345
          Employee Name: John J Doe
          Gross Salary: £13,333.33
          National Insurance contributions: £544.40
          Tax-free allowance: £0.00
          Taxable income: £13,333.33
          Tax Payable: £4,841.67

Calculation rules:

- Income tax (additional rate band) : Any amount of money earned above a gross annual salary of £150,000.00 is taxed at 45%
